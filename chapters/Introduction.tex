\chapter{Introduction}

In our contemporary society, there is a whole variety of information we need to take care of. Starting with information about people, cars, or real estate and ending with information about furniture or logistics, it is hard to imagine the society developing any further without a means of a fast and easy management of such data. Fortunately, in the age of computer science, it is possible to register and aggregate nearly unlimited amount of information thanks to so-called information systems.

In this thesis, the author will describe the way information is managed in terms of theses, and the most common methods of software management and development of information systems. In the practical part of the thesis, the author will describe the architecture and design of the information system for management of theses that was developed as the core project of this thesis. The architecture and design chapter will include the list of the functional and non-functional requirements of the system, and mainly the description of the domain model that was designed. This thesis will also contain most of the technologies that were used for the implementation of the project and the last chapter will discuss some possible improvements that could extend the functionality of the system in the future.
