\chapter{Project Architecture and Design}

In the following text, the author will describe the architecture and design of the Thesis Management System including functional and non-functional requirements, and the domain model. The author will also depict some design parts with UML\footnote{Unified Modeling Language} 2.0 diagrams that were modeled with Visual Paradigm tool\,\cite{visual-paradigm-homepage}, however, the UML diagrams are not to be regarded as blueprints of the system, but rather as sketches, and as such, some information that the author considers irrelevant or obvious are let out. This is allowed as stated by Martin Fowler in his book UML Distilled\,\cite{fowler-uml}.

\section{Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:func-requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item User management\\
    The system allows to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) users. User contains fields full name, email and password.

    \item Registration\\
    Only students can sign up and they have to agree to the terms of use.

    \item Log In\\
    Anonymous users can sign in using email and password.

    \item Thesis topic management\\
    The system allows to CRUD thesis topics. Topic contains fields title and description in two languages and it is possible to assign the list of tags and categories to it. The management of a topic is done by its leader and the list of the universities that the topic is offered to is represented by the university list. There is also a field for the list of university supervisors, each supervisor is assigned a university that they supervise at. One topic can have zero or more university supervisors. Lastly, there is a field for the list of thesis types (which can contain e.g. diploma, bachelor) and a flag that represents enabled/disabled state of the topic to disallow students to apply for it.

    \item Category management\\
    The system allows to CRUD categories. Category contains fields title and description.

    \item University management\\
    The system allows to CRUD universities. University contains a field for the name of the university.

    \item Application management\\
    The system allows to CRUD applications.

    \item Topics can be filtered\\
    The system allows to filter topics by university, type, leader, title, tag or category.

    \item Thesis management\\
    The system allows to CRUD theses. Thesis contains fields title, description, thesis topic, assignee, supervisor, abstract, type, university and the list of tags. There is also a field for status that can be either `in progress', `finished', `failed' or `postponed' and a field for grade that can be one of A, B, C, D, E or F.

    \item Supervisors can select universities they supervise at for each topic

    \item Supervisors can add private notes to theses

    \item Authenticated user can subscribe for topics and theses\\
    The system sends notifications to all subscribers of a topic or a thesis when a change is made to it.

    \item Authenticated user can unsubscribe from topics and theses

    \item Theses can be filtered\\
    The system allows to filter theses by title, supervisor, assignee, status, grade, type, university or tag.

    \item File management for theses\\
    The system allows to upload files to theses.

    \item Discussion for topics and theses\\
    Logged in users can comment on topics and theses and users with certain authority (administrators and leaders) can create comments that are not visible to students and guests.

    \item Full text search\\
    Theses and topics can be searched by a full text search engine.

    \item Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) management\\
    The system allows to CRUD Frequently Asked Questions. One frequently asked question contains fields question and answer.

\end{enumerate}

    \item Software development methodology\\
    The system is developed iteratively and incrementally.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Domain Model}

Designing the domain model is the most important step when developing an information system. It is also the most difficult one, because you usually cannot easily make changes in the domain model after you implemented the application logic around it. You can, however, add some domain model elements that the already-designed elements do not relate to. For example, if you design an entity \texttt{User}, you can implement it and easily add new entity \texttt{Group} later on if the \texttt{Group} is the owner of the relationship, see fig. \ref{fig:user-group-owner-example}. If the \texttt{User} is the owner of the relationship (see fig. \ref{fig:user-owner-group-example}), more refactoring is required to implement such changes (especially in case of object composition), because the fundamental API of the implemented part of the system changed.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim=0 740 290 30, clip, keepaspectratio]{./images/user-group-owner-example.pdf}
    \caption{Example of domain model where \texttt{Group} owns the relationship}
    \label{fig:user-group-owner-example}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim=0 740 290 30, clip, keepaspectratio]{./images/user-owner-group-example.pdf}
    \caption{Example of domain model where \texttt{User} owns the relationship and composition is introduced}
    \label{fig:user-owner-group-example}
\end{figure}

Even more difficult can be deleting or editing attributes of an implemented entity. As a lot of refactoring is necessary to cope with such changes, a lot of new bugs is usually introduced, so it is best to avoid such changes by designing the domain model thoroughly.

Note that it is necessary to change the domain model if you implement your application incrementally. You should, however, try to minimize the changes that require the API of the implemented domain model to be changed.

\subsection{Domain Model of the Thesis Management System}
\label{sec:domain-model-tms}

As the domain model of the Thesis Management System is very complex, the author will describe it part by part. The complete domain model can be found in the appendix A.

\subsubsection{\textbf{\texttt{User} entity}}

To fulfill the first three functional requirements, we need to register users. For that reason, we introduce entity \texttt{User} with fields \texttt{email} and \texttt{password} that serve as log in credentials and field \texttt{fullName}. We also need fields \texttt{accountLocked} to allow the administrator to lock a user account and \texttt{enabled} for registration confirmation purposes. Field \texttt{sendMail} represents the user setting that allows them to disable receiving notifications by email, and field \texttt{dateCreated} represents the date of user's registration. To implement authorization, the \texttt{User} entity needs field \texttt{roles}, which contains the list of user's authorities. Figure \ref{fig:domain-user-entity} illustrates the described model.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim=0 675 480 30, clip, keepaspectratio, scale=0.8]{./images/domain-user-entity.pdf}
    \caption{Model of \texttt{User} entity}
    \label{fig:domain-user-entity}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\textbf{\texttt{University} entity}}

To be able to keep a record of the universities that a topic is offered to, we need the entity \texttt{University} with only one field -- \texttt{name}, see Figure \ref{fig:domain-university-entity}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim=0 770 510 30, clip, keepaspectratio]{./images/domain-university-entity.pdf}
    \caption{Model of \texttt{University} entity}
    \label{fig:domain-university-entity}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\textbf{\texttt{Article}, \texttt{Comment} and \texttt{Subscription} entities}}

To allow users to add comments to topics and theses, we need an entity that represents comments. The name of the entity is, for obvious reasons, \texttt{Comment} and fields that the entity requires are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{content} -- Represents the content of a comment.
    \item \texttt{privateComment} -- Marks private comments.
    \item \texttt{dateCreated} -- The date of creation, this field is used for sorting comments so that we could show the user comments in either descending or ascending order.
\end{itemize}

There are two association we need to create for \texttt{Comment}. First is a many-to-one association between \texttt{Comment} and \texttt{User} to be able to display the author of a comment. Second is a bit more complicated, because there are two approaches to associate comments with topics and theses. We could either create a many-to-one association between entities \texttt{Comment} and \texttt{Topic} and between entities \texttt{Comment} and \texttt{Thesis}, or we could use generalization and move the many-to-one association up from \texttt{Thesis} and \texttt{Topic} to their parent. We choose the later approach because it allows us to create another ``commentable'' entity in the future simply by making it another child of the parent entity.

The \texttt{Article} entity represents the parent entity described above. We place the field \texttt{title} on it for reasons described in the following paragraph.

The \texttt{Subscription} is only an association entity with no attributes on it, but for the sake of future improvements, we model it separately. We could, for example, allow users to choose if they want to receive email notification for a particular subscription, or let them set up what changes made to an \texttt{Article} they want to be notified about. As far as associating the entity with other entities is concerned, it is very similar to the \texttt{Comment} entity, because we need to implement subscription functionality for both topics and theses. We add the field \texttt{title} on the \texttt{Article} entity because we want to show subscribers the name of the \texttt{Article} that changed.

Described model is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:domain-article-comment-subscription-entities}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim=0 620 180 30, clip, keepaspectratio, width=\textwidth]{./images/domain-article-comment-subscription-entities.pdf}
    \caption{Model of \texttt{Article}, \texttt{Comment} and \texttt{Subscription} entities}
    \label{fig:domain-article-comment-subscription-entities}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\textbf{\texttt{Feed} and \texttt{Notification} entities}}

Entities \texttt{Feed} and \texttt{Notification} are quite closely related to the \texttt{Subscription} entity even though they are not directly associated. When a change is made to a topic or a thesis, the subscribers are notified by email and by a notification within the system. Emails are stored by the email hostings, but the notifications need to be stored in the database of the Thesis Management System, because they must be available to users when they visit the system.

Now, there are several ways to implement such functionality, but the most notable ones are the following two. The first approach is to create a \texttt{Notification} entity with the \texttt{message} field that represents the content of the notification, and associate it with the \texttt{User} entity that represents the subscriber. This approach is favorable because it is simple, however, it creates unnecessary redundancy in the database as a new notification with the same \texttt{message} is created for every subscriber. The second approach, which is used in the Thesis Management System, is to create another entity \texttt{Feed} and move the \texttt{message} field into it. The later approach is also more suitable if we want to show the user a notification according to their locale setting. 

Figure \ref{fig:domain-feed-notification-entities} illustrates the model of this part of the system. Since we want the notifications to be localized, the \texttt{Feed} entity has fields \texttt{messageCode}, which represents the code of the massage to be displayed as a notification, \texttt{args}, which represents the arguments of the message, and \texttt{dateCreated}, which allows us to sort the notifications to show users the latest notifications first. The \texttt{Feed} entity is also associated with the \texttt{User} entity, which represents the user who triggered the creation of the feed. This allows us to find user's activity.

The \texttt{Notification} entity is basically an association entity between entities \texttt{User} and \texttt{Feed}. The field \texttt{seen} represents status of a notification, i.e. if the user has already seen the notification or not.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim=0 720 170 30, clip, keepaspectratio, width=\textwidth]{./images/domain-feed-notification-entities.pdf}
    \caption{Model of \texttt{Feed} and \texttt{Notification} entities}
    \label{fig:domain-feed-notification-entities}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\textbf{\texttt{Tag} entity}}

The most common way of implementing tags in an information system is to place collection of simple strings in an entity. We chose a different approach for the Thesis Management System, though. We introduced a separate entity \texttt{Tag} that contains a simple field \texttt{title}. Making the \texttt{Tag} entity separate makes it easy to add new fields on it in the future, e.g. \texttt{description}, and it is easier to aggregate, for example, the number of all tags used in the system. Figure \ref{fig:domain-tag-entity} depicts the model.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim=0 770 510 30, clip, keepaspectratio]{./images/domain-tag-entity.pdf}
    \caption{Model of \texttt{Tag} entity}
    \label{fig:domain-tag-entity}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\textbf{\texttt{Topic}, \texttt{Category} and \texttt{Supervision} entities}}

\texttt{Topic} is the most important entity in the system because it represents the topic of a thesis. It is a child entity of the \texttt{Article} entity, which means that the \texttt{title} field is included in the \texttt{Topic} entity automatically. Description of the other fields follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{secondaryTitle} -- Represents the title of the topic in a different language (e.g. Czech, Slovak).
    \item \texttt{lead} -- Lead paragraph, is displayed on the page with the list of topics.
    \item \texttt{Description} -- Description of the topic.
    \item \texttt{secondaryDescription} -- Represents the description of the topic in a different language.
    \item \texttt{dateCreated} -- The date of creation of the topic.
    \item \texttt{enabled} -- Flag which marks a topic that is enabled or disabled, i.e. students can(not) apply for it.
    \item \texttt{types} -- Collection of types of the topic (e.g. bachelor, diploma).
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{Topic} entity also has a many-to-many association with the \texttt{Tag} entity and the \texttt{User} entity, which represents the leader of the topic, i.e. the user who created the topic and is in charge of it. The association with the \texttt{University} entity is necessary to keep a record of universities that the topic is offered to, i.e. students of which universities can apply for it.

Another requirement of the system is to place topics in categories. Categories are represented by the \texttt{Category} entity, which has only two fields -- the \texttt{name} field, which represents the name of the category and the \texttt{description} field, which is self-explanatory. The \texttt{Topic} entity is associated with the \texttt{Category} entity in a many-to-many manner. In the first stages of the design, we expected the categories to be hierarchical, i.e. a category could have several subcategories, but we decided to abolish that approach as it would place unnecessary overhead on the database.

The most difficult part of the system was to design the requirement allowing topics to list university supervisors. There are zero or more supervisors in one topic, but one supervisor can supervise a topic at multiple universities, which means that the supervisors cannot be associated with the \texttt{Topic} entity directly. Instead, we introduced the \texttt{Supervision} entity, which is basically an association entity without any fields representing a supervisor associated with a university.

Described design is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:domain-topic-category-supervision-entities}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim=0 510 120 30, clip, keepaspectratio, width=\textwidth]{./images/domain-topic-category-supervision-entities.pdf}
    \caption{Model of \texttt{Topic}, \texttt{Category} and \texttt{Supervision} entities}
    \label{fig:domain-topic-category-supervision-entities}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\textbf{\texttt{Thesis} entity}}

The second most important entity of the system is the \texttt{Thesis} entity, it represents an academic project of a student and it is associated with the \texttt{Topic} entity. There can be multiple theses created from one topic for several reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item One topic can be intended for several students (for example when the topic is too difficult for one student), which means that a thesis for each student needs to be created.
    \item The topic is offered in more than one semester.
    \item The student that was assigned to the thesis of a topic failed to finish with a satisfactory result and the topic has to be offered again.
\end{itemize}

This means that the cardinality of the association with the \texttt{Topic} entity must be a many-to-one one.

The \texttt{Thesis} entity is, as well as the \texttt{Topic} entity, a child of the \texttt{Article} entity, which takes care of the title, comments and subscriptions. Theses are not required to be stored in two languages, which means that there is no need for both the secondary title and the secondary description. There are several other fields required, though:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{description} -- Represents the \emph{official} description of a thesis.
    \item \texttt{status} -- Status of a thesis, which can be either `in progress', `finished', `failed' or `postponed'.
    \item \texttt{grade} -- If the thesis is finished, a grade must be awarded. The grade can be one of the following: A, B, C, D, E, F.
    \item \texttt{abstract} -- The abstract of a thesis provided by the assigned student.
    \item \texttt{dateCreated} -- The date of creation of a thesis.
    \item \texttt{type} -- The type of a thesis, which can be for example `bachelor' or `diploma'.
    \item \texttt{notes} -- A field for the supervisor where they can leave notes related to the thesis.
\end{itemize}

The student that is assigned to a thesis and the supervisor are represented by the associations with the \texttt{User} entity and the thesis university is represented by the one with the \texttt{University}. The tags of a thesis are designed the same way as with the \texttt{Topic} entity. The reason why the association with the \texttt{Tag} entity is not moved up to the \texttt{Article} entity is because in the future, there might be added a functionality for management of school projects that does not require tags, but requires the functionality provided by the \texttt{Article} entity.

Figure \ref{fig:domain-thesis-entity} illustrates this model.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim=0 600 190 30, clip, keepaspectratio, width=\textwidth]{./images/domain-thesis-entity.pdf}
    \caption{Model of \texttt{Thesis} entity}
    \label{fig:domain-thesis-entity}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\textbf{\texttt{Application} entity}}

When a student applies for a topic, an application must be created to allow the leader or a supervisor to review and possibly approve it. To apply for a topic, a student must choose the type and the university for which they apply. The type is stored in the \texttt{type} field and the university is represented by the association with the \texttt{University} entity. The student can also leave a note, e.g. the preferred supervisor, which is stored in the \texttt{note} field. The \texttt{dateCreated} field allows the authority (leader or supervisor) to see what application was created first and the \texttt{approved} field marks applications that were already approved. The association with the \texttt{User} and the \texttt{Topic} entity represents the student who applied for the topic and the topic that the application is created for, respectively. The association with the \texttt{Thesis} entity allows us to display the thesis that was created from an application. Note that this association has a 0..1 multiplicity (in both directions). This is because when a student applies for a topic, the thesis has not been created yet, because it is created as soon as the leader or a supervisor approves it. The multiplicity from the other direction results from the fact that a thesis can be created directly from a topic (i.e. no application is created). This model is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:domain-application-entity}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim=10 630 200 30, clip, keepaspectratio, width=\textwidth]{./images/domain-application-entity.pdf}
    \caption{Model of \texttt{Application} entity}
    \label{fig:domain-application-entity}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\textbf{\texttt{Faq} entity}}

To allow new users to adapt to a new system more quickly, Frequently Asked Questions are introduced. The FAQ are represented by the \texttt{Faq} entity with the following fields:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{question} -- The question to be answered.
    \item \texttt{answer} -- The answer to the frequently asked question.
    \item \texttt{locale} -- The locale of the users for whom the frequently asked question is displayed.
\end{itemize}

See figure \ref{fig:domain-faq-entity} to see the designed model.

\begin{figure}[h]

        \includegraphics[trim=0 740 510 30, clip, keepaspectratio]{./images/domain-faq-entity.pdf}

\end{figure}

\section{Implementation}

The core project of this thesis is created by three students, therefore the implementation of it will be described in the thesis of student Jakub Čecháček.

\section{Evaluation}

In this section, the author will evaluate all functional and non-functional requirements.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:eval-func-requirements}

This section contains evaluation of all functional requirements. Please refer to section \ref{sec:func-requirements} to see the list with the description.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item User management\\
    Anyone can access users' profiles (show page). The administrator can create new users on the page with the list of users, when they do, the password is sent to the entered user's email and activation is required. The administrator can also edit and delete users in the users' profiles.

    \item Registration\\
    Anonymous users can sign up on the registration page, but it is only possible to register with email addresses hosted at a domain address that is explicitly entered in the system configuration by an administrator. It is also necessary to agree to the terms of use, otherwise it is not possible to complete the registration. When a user sings up, an activation email is send to their email address. If the user activates their account, the registration is complete, if not, it is not possible to log in and the account is deleted after 30 days.

    \item Log In\\
    Anonymous users can sign in using email and password if their account is activated. If the user does not remember their password, they can request a new password to be send to their email address.

    \item Thesis topic management\\
    List and details of topics can be accessed by anyone. Leaders can also create new topics, and edit and delete topics that they created. Deletion of topics that were already applied to is not possible unless the applications and theses associated with them are deleted. All required fields are available.

    \item Category management\\
    The list of categories is displayed on the page with the list of topics. Only administrators can create, edit or delete categories. It is not possible, however, to delete categories that already contain some topics. Instead, the topics must be either deleted or removed from the category first. The description field is shown as a tooltip text for each category unless it is not filled in. 

    \item University management\\
    Universities can be browsed by anyone, but only administrators can create, edit and delete universities. As a safety precaution, a university cannot be deleted if there are already topics, applications or theses associated with it (to delete such university, the associated theses, applications and topics must be deleted first).

    \item Application management\\
    Students can apply for topics by clicking on the button placed on the page showing a particular topic. When they do, they choose their university, the type of their study (Bachelor, Diploma) and optionally they provide a note. A notification is sent to the leader of the applied topic. The leader can decide to approve the application by clicking on the button ``Approve'', when they do, they are redirected to the page with a form for thesis and they have to create it to approve the application. If the leader approves the application, its student is automatically notified.

    \item Topics can be filtered\\
    The system allows to filter topics by university, type, leader's full name, title, tag or category. All these filter options can be combined, the title and leader's full name is case insensitive, but unfortunately they are currently  sensitive to foreign characters.

    \item Thesis management\\
    Similarly to topic management, the list and details of theses can be accessed by anyone. Supervisors and Leaders can create new topics either from scratch, application or topic. Theses they created can be also deleted or edited by them. All required fields are available.

    \item Supervisors can select universities they supervise at for each topic\\
    There is a ``My Supervisions'' button on the page with a topic. When a supervisor uses the button, they are redirected to a page where they can choose universities they supervise at for a particular topic.

    \item Supervisors can add private notes to theses\\
    There is a ``Notes'' button on the page with a thesis. When a supervisor clicks on the button, a popup box with a textarea is displayed. They can enter or delete text as they wish, to save the notes, they have to use the ``Save'' button.

    \item Authenticated user can subscribe for topics and theses\\
    The ``Subscribe'' button is displayed on every page of topics and theses. If a user subscribes for a topic or thesis, they are sent notifications about all actions that are made to it, which includes edits, deletes and comment creates.

    \item Authenticated user can unsubscribe from topics and theses\\
    If a user does not with to receive notifications about actions made to topics or theses anymore, they can use the ``Unsubscribe'' button.

    \item Theses can be filtered\\
    The system allows to filter theses by title, supervisor's full name, assignee's full name, status, grade, type, university or tag. All these filter options can be combined, the title, supervisor's full name and assignee's full name are case insensitive, but unfortunately they are currently sensitive to foreign characters.

    \item File management for theses\\
    Students can upload files to their theses on the thesis page by first selecting the files to be uploaded by the ``Select Files'' button and starting the upload by the ``Start Upload'' button. The supervisor of the thesis and the leader of the thesis' topic can also upload files to it.

    \item Discussion for topics and theses\\
    Authenticated users can comment on topics and thesis. They can also edit or delete their comments. The administrators and leaders can create private comments that are visible only to users with those roles. The administrator can edit and delete any comment (not only those created by them), the leader can edit and delete comments that are created in topics created by them.

    \item Full text search\\
    There is a search box available on every page. If a user uses it, they are redirected to a page with the search results. 

    \item Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) management\\
    Administrators can create/delete/edit frequently asked questions. The questions are internationalized and therefore an administrator not only needs to fill in the question and the answer of a FAQ, but they also have to choose the locale of the FAQ. Users see only FAQs created for the locale that they use.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}

This section contains evaluation of all non-functional requirements. Please refer to section \ref{sec:non-func-requirements} to see the list with the description.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Grails platform\\
    This requirement was fulfilled by implementing the system using the Grails framework.

    \item Authentication and authorization\\
    The system requires the users to be authenticated to allow them to use most of the functionality. There are four roles -- Admin, Leader, Supervisor and Student, and each role has certain permissions, read section \ref{sec:eval-func-requirements} for more information.

    \item Performance\\
    We created a script that put 500 topics, theses, users, applications and universities in the database of the Thesis Management System. The system's performance did not seem to be affected at all.

    \item Deployment\\
    The system is deployed on OpenShift using medium gear and cartridge JBoss EWS 2.0. To deploy the Thesis Management System on a different instance of OpenShift, follow these steps:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Create an OpenShift JBoss EWS 2 cartridge and add PostgreSQL and MongoDB cartridges.
        \item Add remote OpenShift repository to your local project git repository.
        \item Create file \texttt{.myenv} on OpenShift in the directory exported in \texttt{\$OPENSHIFT\_DATA\_DIR} with email credentials as environment variables like this:
            \begin{verbatim}
export OPENSHIFT_EMAIL_HOST="smtp.example.com"
export OPENSHIFT_EMAIL_PORT=465
export OPENSHIFT_EMAIL_USERNAME="e@exmpl.com"
export OPENSHIFT_EMAIL_PASSWORD="password"
            \end{verbatim}
        \item Push your local repository to OpenShift.

        \item[\emph{Note:}] You need at least medium gear, otherwise grails will not be able to build the application due to memory limitation. Or you can use small gear and build the application yourself.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item License\\
    We chose the MIT license\,\cite{mit-license} for the Thesis Management System, which is a GPL compatible license\,\cite{gpl-compatible-licenses}.

    \item Backup\\
    There is available a shell script \texttt{backup.sh} for backing up both PostgreSQL and MongoDB. To create the backup, you just execute command \texttt{sh backup.sh} on OpenShift, which will create directory \texttt{thesis\_backup\_mongo} (containing the MongoDB backup) and file \texttt{thesis\_backup\_postgres.sql} (containing backup of PostgreSQL) in directory \texttt{\$OPENSHIFT\_DATA\_DIR}.

    \item Internationalization and localization\\
    The system is internationalized and localized in English and Czech. The locale is either chosen from HTTP headers or the user can choose one by themselves.

    \item Software development methodology\\
    The system is developed iteratively and incrementally, see section \ref{sec:tms-methodology} for more details.
