\chapter{Project Architecture and Design}

In the following text, the author will describe the architecture and design of the Thesis Management System including functional, non-functional requirements and the domain model. The author will also depict some design parts with UML\footnote{Unified Modeling Language} 2.0 diagrams, however, the UML diagrams are not to be regarded as blueprints of the system but rather as sketches and as such, some information that the author considers irrelevant or obvious could be let out. This is allowed as stated by Martin Fowler in his book UML Distilled\cite{fowler-uml}.

\section{Domain Model}

Designing the domain model is the most important step when designing an information system. It is also the most difficult one, because you usually cannot easily make changes in the domain model after you implemented the application logic around it. You can, however, add some domain model elements that the already-designed elements do not relate to. For example, if you design an entity \texttt{User}, you can implement it and easily add new entity \texttt{Group} later on if the \texttt{Group} is the owner of the relationship, see fig. \ref{fig:user-group-owner-example}. If the \texttt{User} is the owner of the relationship (see fig. \ref{fig:user-owner-group-example}), more refactoring is required to implement such changes (especially in case of object composition), because the fundamental API of the implemented part of the system changed.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim=0 740 290 30, clip, keepaspectratio]{./images/user-group-owner-example.pdf}
    \caption{Example of domain model where \texttt{Group} owns the relationship}
    \label{fig:user-group-owner-example}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim=0 740 290 30, clip, keepaspectratio]{./images/user-owner-group-example.pdf}
    \caption{Example of domain model where \texttt{User} owns the relationship and composition is introduced}
    \label{fig:user-owner-group-example}
\end{figure}

Even more difficult can be deleting or editing attributes of an implemented entity. As a lot of refactoring is necessary to cope with such changes, a lot of new bugs is usually introduced, so it is best to avoid such changes by designing the domain model thoroughly.

Note that it is necessary to change the domain model if you implement your application incrementally. You should, however, try to minimize changes that require the API of the implemented domain model to be changed.

\subsection{Domain Model of the Thesis Management System}

As the domain model of the Thesis Management System is very complex, the author will describe it part by part.

\subsubsection{\texttt{User} entity}

To fulfill the first three functional requirements, we need to register users. For that reason, we introduce entity \texttt{User} with fields \texttt{email} and \texttt{password} that serve as log in credentials and field \texttt{fullName}. We also need fields \texttt{accountLocked} to allow the administrator to lock a user account and \texttt{enabled} for registration confirmation purposes. Field \texttt{sendMail} represents user setting that allows them to disable receiving notifications by email and field \texttt{dateCreated} represents the date of registration. To implement authorization, the \texttt{User} entity needs field \texttt{roles} which contains list of user's authorities. Figure \ref{fig:domain-user-entity} illustrates the described model.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim=0 675 480 30, clip, keepaspectratio, scale=0.8]{./images/domain-user-entity.pdf}
    \caption{Model of \texttt{User} entity}
    \label{fig:domain-user-entity}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\texttt{University} entity}

To be able to keep a record of universities that a thesis topic is offered to, we need the entity \texttt{University} with only one field -- \texttt{name}, see Figure \ref{fig:domain-university-entity}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim=0 770 510 30, clip, keepaspectratio]{./images/domain-university-entity.pdf}
    \caption{Model of \texttt{University} entity}
    \label{fig:domain-university-entity}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\texttt{Article}, \texttt{Comment} and \texttt{Subscription} entities}

To allow users to add comments to thesis topics and theses, we need an entity that represents comments. The name of the entity is, for obvious reasons, \texttt{Comment} and fields that the entity requires are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{content} -- represents the content of the comment
    \item \texttt{privateComment} -- mark if the comment is private
    \item \texttt{dateCreated} -- the date of creation, this field is used for sorting the comments so that we could show the user comments in either descending or ascending order
\end{itemize}

There are two association we need to create for \texttt{Comment}. First is a many-to-one association between \texttt{Comment} and \texttt{User} to be able to display the author of a comment. Second is a bit more complicated because there are two approaches to associate comments with thesis topics and theses. We could either create a many-to-one association between entities \texttt{Comment} and \texttt{Topic} and between entities \texttt{Comment} and \texttt{Thesis} or we could use generalization and move the many-to-one association up from \texttt{Thesis} and \texttt{Topic} to their parent. We choose the later approach because it allows us to create another ``commentable'' entity in the future simply by making it another child of the parent entity.

The \texttt{Article} entity represents the parent entity described above. We place the field \texttt{title} on it for reasons depicted in the following text.

The \texttt{Subscription} is only an association entity with no attributes on it but for the sake of future improvements, we model it separately. We could, for example, allow users to choose if they want to receive email notification for a particular subscription or let them set up what changes to an \texttt{Article} they want to be notified about. As far as associating the entity with other entities is concerned, it is very similar to the \texttt{Comment} entity because we need to implement subscription functionality for both topics and theses. We add the field \texttt{title} on the \texttt{Article} entity because we want to show subscribers the name of the \texttt{Article} that changed.

Described model is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:domain-article-comment-subscription-entities}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim=0 620 180 30, clip, keepaspectratio, width=\textwidth]{./images/domain-article-comment-subscription-entities.pdf}
    \caption{Model of \texttt{Article}, \texttt{Comment} and \texttt{Subscription} entities}
    \label{fig:domain-article-comment-subscription-entities}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\texttt{Feed} and \texttt{Notification} entities}

Entities \texttt{Feed} and \texttt{Notification} are quite closely related to the \texttt{Subscription} entity even though they are not directly associated. When a change is made to a topic or a thesis, the subscribers are notified by email and by a notification within the system. Emails are stored by the email hostings but the notifications need to be stored in the database of the Thesis Management System because they must be available to users when they visit the system.

Now, there are several ways how to implement such functionality but the most notable are the following two. The first approach is to create a \texttt{Notification} entity with fields including \texttt{message} that represents the content of the notification and associate it with the \texttt{User} entity that represents the subscriber. This approach is favorable because it is simple, however, it creates unnecessary redundancy in the database as a new notification with the same \texttt{message} is created for every subscriber. The second approach, which is used in the Thesis Management System, is to create another entity \texttt{Feed} and move the \texttt{message} field onto it. The later approach is also more suitable if we want to show the user a notification according to their locale setting. 

Figure \ref{fig:domain-feed-notification-entities} illustrates the model of this part of the system. Since we want the notifications to be localized, the \texttt{Feed} entity has fields \texttt{messageCode}, which represents the code of the massage to be displayed as a notification, \texttt{args}, which represents the arguments of the message and \texttt{dateCreated}, which allows us to sort the notifications to show users the latest notifications first. The \texttt{Feed} entity is also associated with the \texttt{User} entity which represents the user who triggered the creation of the feed. This allows us to find user's activity.

The \texttt{Notification} entity is basically an association entity between entities \texttt{User} and \texttt{Feed}. The field \texttt{seen} represents status of a notification, i.e. if the user has already seen the notification or not.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Model of \texttt{Feed} and \texttt{Notification} entities}
    \label{fig:domain-feed-notification-entities}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\texttt{Tag} entity}

The most common way of implementing tags in an information system is to place collection of simple strings in an entity. We chose a different approach for the Thesis Management System, though. We introduced a separate entity \texttt{Tag} that contains a simple field \texttt{title}. Making the \texttt{Tag} entity separate makes it easy to add new fields on it in the future, e.g. \texttt{description}, and it is easier to aggregate, for example, number of all tags used in the system. Figure \ref{fig:domain-tag-entity} depicts the model.
