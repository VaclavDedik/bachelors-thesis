\chapter{Project Architecture and Design}

In the following text, the author will describe the architecture and design of the Thesis Management System including functional, non-functional requirements and the domain model. The author will also depict some design parts with UML\footnote{Unified Modeling Language} 2.0 diagrams, however, the UML diagrams are not to be regarded as blueprints of the system but rather as sketches and as such, some information that the author considers irrelevant or obvious could be let out. This is allowed as stated by Martin Fowler in his book UML Distilled\cite{fowler-uml}.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item User management\\
    The system allows to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) users. User contains fields full name, email and password.

    Anonymous users can sign up only with emails hosted at configured domain addresses.

    \item Log In\\
    Anonymous users can sign in using email and password.

    \item Site configuration\\
    Administrator can configure certain aspects of the system, like allowed email domain addresses, site announcement and the terms of use.

    \item Thesis topic management\\
    The system allows to CRUD thesis topics. Topic contains fields title and description in two languages.

    \item Category management\\
    The system allows to CRUD categories. Category contains fields title and description.

    \item Thesis topic can be added to categories.\\
    Topics can be added to one or more categories which allows users to browse topics in categories.

    \item Tags can be assigned to thesis topics\\
    There can be zero or more tags assigned to one thesis topic.

    \item Thesis topic contains field for an external supervisor (owner)\\
    The owner has the authority to manage thesis topics created by them.

    The system sends notifications to all subscribers of a thesis topic or a thesis when a change is made to it.

    \item Authenticated user can unsubscribe from thesis topics and theses

    \item Theses can be filtered\\
    The system allows to filter theses by title, supervisor, assignee, status, grade, type or university.

    \item Theses and thesis topics can be filtered by tags\\
    The system allows to list theses or thesis topics that contains a particular tag.

    \item File management for theses\\
    The system allows to upload files to theses.

    \item Discussion for thesis topics and theses\\
    Logged in users can comment on thesis topics and theses.

    \item Private comments\\
    Users with certain authority can create comments that are not visible to students and guests.

    \item Full text search\\
    Theses and thesis topics can be searched by a full text search engine.

    \item Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) management\\
    The system allows to CRUD Frequently Asked Questions. One frequently asked question contains fields question, answer and locale.

\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Grails platform\\
    The system is implemented using platform Grails.

    \item Authentication and authorization\\
    The system is secured and there are four roles -- \textbf{Administrator} that can manage users, categories, FAQ and universities, \textbf{Owner} that can create thesis topics and manage thesis topics created by them, \textbf{Supervisor} that can create theses and manage theses created by them and \textbf{Student} that can apply for a thesis topic.

    \item Performance\\
    The system offers reasonable performance at least up to five hundred created thesis topics, theses, users and universities.

    \item Deployment\\
    The system is deployed on OpenShift using any cartridge other than Do It Yourself.

    \item License\\
    The system is licensed under any GPL compatible license.

    \item Backup\\
    Create a shell script for backing up the database.

    \item Internationalization and localization\\
    The system is internationalized and localized in English and Czech.

    \item Software development methodology\\
    The system is developed iteratively and incrementally.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Domain Model}

Designing the domain model is the most important step when designing an information system. It is also the most difficult one, because you usually cannot easily make changes in the domain model after you implemented the application logic around it. You can, however, add some domain model elements that the already-designed elements do not relate to. For example, if you design an entity \texttt{User}, you can implement it and easily add new entity \texttt{Group} later on if the \texttt{Group} is the owner of the relationship, see fig. \ref{fig:user-group-owner-example}. If the \texttt{User} is the owner of the relationship (see fig. \ref{fig:user-owner-group-example}), more refactoring is required to implement such changes (especially in case of object composition), because the fundamental API of the implemented part of the system changed.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim=0 740 290 30, clip, keepaspectratio]{./images/user-group-owner-example.pdf}
    \caption{Example of domain model where \texttt{Group} owns the relationship}
    \label{fig:user-group-owner-example}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim=0 740 290 30, clip, keepaspectratio]{./images/user-owner-group-example.pdf}
    \caption{Example of domain model where \texttt{User} owns the relationship and composition is introduced}
    \label{fig:user-owner-group-example}
\end{figure}

Even more difficult can be deleting or editing attributes of an implemented entity. As a lot of refactoring is necessary to cope with such changes, a lot of new bugs is usually introduced, so it is best to avoid such changes by designing the domain model thoroughly.

Note that it is necessary to change the domain model if you implement your application incrementally. You should, however, try to minimize changes that require the API of the implemented domain model to be changed.

\subsection{Domain Model of the Thesis Management System}

As the domain model of the Thesis Management System is very complex, the author will describe it part by part.

\subsubsection{\texttt{User} entity}

To fulfill the first three functional requirements, we need to register users. For that reason, we introduce entity \texttt{User} with fields \texttt{email} and \texttt{password} that serve as log in credentials and field \texttt{fullName}. We also need fields \texttt{accountLocked} to allow the administrator to lock a user account and \texttt{enabled} for registration confirmation purposes. Field \texttt{sendMail} represents user setting that allows them to disable receiving notifications by email and field \texttt{dateCreated} represents the date of registration. To implement authorization, the \texttt{User} entity needs field \texttt{roles} which contains list of user's authorities. An authority is represented by enumeration \texttt{Role}. Figure \ref{fig:domain-user-entity} illustrates the described model.

    \caption{Model of \texttt{User} entity}
    \label{fig:domain-user-entity}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\texttt{University} entity}

The only field the \texttt{University} entity requires is \texttt{name}, see figure \ref{fig:domain-university-entity}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\texttt{Article}, \texttt{Comment} and \texttt{Subscription} entities}

Subscription is just an association entity but for the sake of future improvements
