\chapter{Conclusion}

The main objective of this thesis was to implement an information system for thesis management. In this document, the author briefly analyzed and described the thesis management and several software development methodologies. In the second part of the thesis, the focus was moved towards the technologies that were used for the implementation of the system, and its architecture and design in which the author covered the functional and non-functional requirements of the system and mainly its domain model. The last chapter outlined a few possibilities of improvements that could be dealt with in the future.

As with everything else, the development of the system was accompanied with several difficulties, it was, however, successfully finished and the system is currently being used by Red Hat people. Furthermore, it has proved to be reliable, scalable and usable, but only the time will tell how much those properties hold in the long run.
